      I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of British
      Columbia turned software engineer. After graduating into the COVID-19
      pandemic I pivoted quickly and taught myself Python and JavaScript over an
      intense 6 months, managing to land a job at a start up soon after. Here I
      continued building onto my new skillset working with Shopify, Flutter,
      React and Drupal. My degree has given me a diverse skillset including
      management, problem solving, technical ability, and progressive thinking.
      For a full list of my skills please refer to my Resume. If you would like
      to learn more about me personally,
