      I am a recent (2020) Mechanical Engineering graduate at the University of
      British Columbia and registered EIT with a desire for continuous learning
      and challenging projects. I’m data centric, with a strong attention to
      detail. I enjoy working in creative, fast paced environments, learn new
      concepts quickly, and deliver under pressure. I am very driven, and find
      the most reward from completing difficult tasks. I have experience with
      both product and software development, where in my co-ops I was tasked
      with product design work, technical writing, cross-team communication,
      presentations, managing budgets and timelines, and participating in the
      development process from start to finish. I was introduced to coding
      during my degree by taking Java courses, and then continued to self-teach
      Python and HTML/CSS in parallel with my studies. To further my education,
      I have also taken Udemy courses for Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I
      strive to keep furthering my knowledge and am not afraid to take on new
      endeavors or wear many hats. My degree has given me a diverse skillset
      including management, problem solving, technical ability, progressive
      thinking as well as being equally comfortable in both a team based or
      individual role. For a full list of my skills please refer to my CV, which
      can be accessed through the header at the top of the page. Outside of
      school I have also built up my teamwork and communication skills through
      my work experience, where over 7 years of lifeguarding and customer
      service has directly given me experience in both leadership and support
      roles in dynamic settings. During my degree I worked at the local ski and
      bike shop as a sales associate and technician, where my time out on the
      floor has taught me how to ask relevant questions and directly connect
      with others. My passion shows through both my personal projects as well as
      leisure activities, and in my free time I’m skiing, biking, or hiking. My
      time in the backcountry has engrained self-discipline and determination
      during many multi-day trips or all-day efforts.
